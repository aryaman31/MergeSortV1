# MergeSortV1
Really inefficient version of a merge sort in python made with simple concepts. 

Learnt about Merge Sort recently so decided to make it in python. It was much harder to program than when i first thought. 

The program generates its own random list 'lis' but you can change it to anything you want. It will print out the steps after it has been competely split up.
